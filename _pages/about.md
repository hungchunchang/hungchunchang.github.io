## Biography

Hi, I am **Hung-Chun (Jonathan) Chang**, a Master's student in **Psychology** at **National Taiwan University (NTU)**. My research lives at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Social Robotics**. 

I am particularly interested in designing intelligent systems that facilitate meaningful human-AI interactions. My work often focuses on **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**, **Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)**, and **Gerontechnology**. I believe that by combining psychological insights with engineering, we can create technology that is not only functional but also empathetic and accessible to diverse populations.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the **Social Lab HRI group** led by Prof. Hsiu-Ping Yueh. My recent projects include developing **ECRobot**, an ITS robot designed with an empathetic algorithm based on prospect theory, and **XiaoXiao**, a companion robot aimed at improving the well-being of older adults. 

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. at NTU in an interdisciplinary program covering **HCI**

When I'm not coding in Python or Swift, I enjoy cycling and running, I finished 2 half-marathon and several road running event in 2025.
